This action makes it easy to use [Cider](https://cidertool.github.io/cider) in your Github Actions workflows.

## Usage

```yaml
- uses: actions/checkout@v2
- uses: cidertool/cider-action@v1
  with:
      # Version of Cider to use. For example, 'v0.0.2'
      # Default: latest
      version: 'latest'
      # Arguments to pass to Cider. See the Command Reference for guidance on what's supported. This field is required because otherwise Cider won't do anything of consequence.
      #
      # https://cidertool.github.io/cider/commands/
      args: ''
      # Workdir is the current directory to run Cider from, relative to the repository root.
      # Default: '.'
      workdir: '.'
  env:
      # The auto-generated GitHub token is required in order to download release assets from the GitHub API.
      GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

Run this in any context you see fit to use Cider to update app metadata or submit new versions of your apps to the App Store.
